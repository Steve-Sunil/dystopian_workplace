# PROJECT 50K


## Project Overview

This tool integrates four different approaches to identify and mitigate workplace bias:

1. **AI-driven Slack Analysis**  
   - Uses AI to analyse Slack chats and gauge employeesâ€™ attitudes and involvement.  
   - Detects subtle patterns that may indicate bias or microaggressions in communication.

2. **Survey Data Analysis**  
   - Collects and interprets data from employee surveys to understand perceptions of inclusion and bias.  

3. **Real-life Scenario Simulations**  
   - Uses interactive simulations to model real workplace scenarios and gather behavioral insights.

4. **USING AI MODELS**
   - Training and use of model to predict work life balance
   - Training and use of model to predict wellbeing
     
By combining these approaches, the tool provides actionable insights for HR teams and managers to create a more inclusive workplace.
